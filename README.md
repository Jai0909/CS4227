## Project Overview

This project explores the adoption of microservices architecture by Netflix, examining the principles, benefits, and challenges associated with microservices. Additionally, it provides reflections on architectural patterns and project management methodologies used in software development projects.

## Contents

### 1. Netflix Arc

This document provides an in-depth analysis of Netflix's transition to microservices architecture. It covers:

- **Introduction to Microservices**:
  - Definition and fundamental principles of microservices architecture.
  - Comparison with monolithic architecture.
  - Key benefits such as scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation.

- **Netflix's Adoption of Microservices**:
  - Migration process from monolithic to microservices.
  - Segmentation of Netflix's application into independent microservices.
  - Integration of external services and handling of big data.

- **Detailed Concepts**:
  - **Scalability**: Independent scaling of services based on demand.
  - **Load Balancing**: Client-side load balancing for efficient request handling.
  - **Caching**: Use of EVCache to improve data retrieval speeds.
  - **Release Management**: Canary releases for testing updates with minimal risk.

### 2. Reflection Report

This document includes reflections on architectural patterns and project management techniques used in software development:

- **MVC Architecture**:
  - Explanation of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
  - Application of MVC in projects such as "Fuel Price Comparison" and a restaurant management system.

- **Project Management Techniques**:
  - Use of Agile methodologies in corporate environments like LM Ericsson.
  - Benefits of Agile in terms of flexibility, iterative development, and stakeholder collaboration.

- **Architectural Patterns**:
  - Exploration of additional patterns like microservices, client-server, adapter, and repository patterns.
  - Impact of these patterns on scalability, reliability, and maintainability of applications.
